# spoken-to-written

It is a python code for changing spoken english to written english
For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.
Handling of these cases is implemented primarily.
Other cases such as handling of dates and numbers for example twenty one thousand and three hundred as 21300.
handling of punctuations is not done like if we give a fullstop at the end of triple A it is not considered and hence not changed to AAA
